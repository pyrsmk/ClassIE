ClassIE
=======

ClassIE is an unobstrusive tiny library which automates IE browser detection in CSS by adding classes to the `html` markup as: `<html class="ie8">`.

All Internet Explorer versions are supported from IE5 (which will be detected as IE6).

Using ClassIE is pretty simple:
- add the script to your pages
- add .ie6, .ie7, .ie8, etc, to your CSS to define specific properties

Thanks to James Padolsey for his wonderful CC IE detection idea.
